Mac is an incedable platform to work on, but no platform is perfect. There are always different approaches to certain things or just missing features Apple didn't or won't add. Here are several tips and tricks I use very often to easy my workflow or just add some cool features. Some of these features also work on other Unix systems.

# Applications

#### LaTeX

LaTeX is one of the most important tools for scientific reporting and a universal standerd in academia. LaTeX was first intoduced in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and is still under active development. To write LaTeX documents you need an editor, TeXShop is one of the best for Mac. LaTeX is mostly distributed in a distibution, <abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr> [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/).

#### Code editor

There are a ton of code editors available on the web, most of them trying to do everything or just nothing. A balans is often had to find, but [Brackets](http://brackets.io) is one of the few editors worth a mention. It is actually a bare text editor with some additions for web design. But you can expand functionality, with plugins. I use it most often for small code edits and text file edits. However, for specific languages, such as Python, I use other editors specifically targetting these languages because of additional support for language specific editing and compilation.

One of the projects I am doing is this website. This entire website is written using Brackets and the W3C validator (and the occasional tutorial found on the web). My readmes are other examples of thing I write in Bracktes, because they are always (a form of) Markdown. However, as mentioned above, for Python I use another editor, namely [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

#### Package manager

#### Pakket beheer

People who work in the console (often or form time to time) have perhaps noticed something: installing additional command line tools can be a pain. Apple doesn't ship a package manager with OS X. So you'll have to install one yourself. There are serveral popular package managers available for downloand [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org), [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org) and [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh).

HomeBrew is the package manager I personally prefer. It's just a personal choise. If you are still doubleful, [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32724/what-are-pros-and-cons-for-macports-fink-and-homebrew) post on StackExchange might shed some light.

#### Git

Editing code form time to time? Doing some coding projects? Then version control is something you should definiately use! VEr
