A review of my career at Ghent University and the courses I applied to. Some of them were very useful and interesting, others were true disappointments or just useless. My overall feeling was that these 5 years of study have lead to some useful skills and insights, so I look back with a good feeling of my education at Ghent University.

## Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering

### First Bachelor

The first bachelor year treats rather broad topics in engineering and lays the fundaments for more advanced course. Although the topics are broad, a lot is usually covered in each of these courses, making the workload during the first year quite large though there are no projects. In stead, there are test during the first semester such that students can assess their knowledge and monitor their progress with what is expected. I found this to be rather restricting because it forced me to study particular courses more that others due to the timing of each test.

<div class="course_list">
* <span class="english">Chemistry</span> (<span class="dutch">Algemene scheikunde</span>)<br/>
  A general course about the basics of chemistry. Most of it was interesting and basic knowledge for every engineering discipline.
* <span class="english">Business</span> (<span class="dutch">Bedrijfskunde</span>) 👎<br/>
  This was the most pointless course of the entire bachelor. The lessons were utterly stupid, the course material inconsistent and the exam a dumb multiple choice exam that tested ones capability to memorise details and not the overall picture.
* <span class="english">Discrete Mathematics</span> (<span class="dutch">Discrete wiskunde</span>)<br/>
  Some concepts on graph theory, fields and other describe mathematical concepts. Farily interesting and the basics for later course (although most of them do a quick recap these concepts).
* <span class="english">Informatics</span> (<span class="dutch">Informatica</span>)<br/>
  My first real encounter with programming. Although I like programming (at lot), it was done using Java. Java has since become one of the languages I tend to avoid as much as possible.
* <span class="english">Engineering Project I</span> (<span class="dutch">Ingenieursproject I</span>)<br/>
  A project course, I did some some simulations and exercises around cable television. This was pretty theoretical and not all that useful later on, but the work load was quite small compared to projects in other courses in the second and third bachelor.
* <span class="english">Material Technology: Concept and Project</span> (<span class="dutch">Materiaaltechnologie: basisconcept en project</span>)<br/>
  Might be interesting for people interested in Material Science. I found this course rather useless for electrical engineering students. Same goes for the labs, directed only to people in construction and chemistry.
* <span class="english">Geometry and Linear Algebra</span> (<span class="dutch">Meetkunde en lineaire algebra</span>)<br/>
  One of the most interesting course of the first bachelor year! Great balance between theory and mathematical applications (do not read: engineering applications). Very instructive use of Maple (mathematical software).
* <span class="english">Physics I</span> (<span class="dutch">Natuurkunde I</span>)<br/>
  The martial was interesting, but the lecturer did not present it that way. Not all that useful, but an OK extension to secondary education.
* <span class="english">Probability Calculus and Statistics</span> (<span class="dutch">Waarschijnlijkheidsrekenen en statistiek</span>)<br/>
  Should really be called "Probability Calculus" since Statistics is only briefly touched during this course. Basics about probability theory (Bayes, CDF...), elementary for later course. Interesting, but the way the exam works (multiple choice) is not suited for this type of course.
* <span class="english">Mathematical Calculus I: Functions of one Variable</span> (<span class="dutch">Wiskundige analyse I: functies van één veranderlijke</span>)<br/>
  Interesting but very difficult course, but too theoretical and not enough focus on real applications of the concepts.
* <span class="english">Mathematical Calculus II: Functions of Multiple Variables</span> (<span class="dutch">Wiskundige analyse II: functies van meer veranderlijken</span>)<br/>
  More of the same.
* <span class="english">Mathematical Basics</span> (<span class="dutch">Wiskundige basistechniek</span>)<br/>
  Course that's only taught in the first three weeks of the first semester. Aims at repeating everything that's considered basic knowledge (trust me: a lot of it will be on a much higher level of abstraction than what you're used to).
</div>

The first bachelor was mostly theoretical and general course. Most of the disciplines are represented in some way or another, some with a real course e.g. _Phyics_ for the Bachelor in Applied Physics and _Material Technology_ and _Chemistry_ for the bachelor in Chemistry and Material Science. However, what saddens me is that this is not the case for Electrical Engineering.

### Second Bachelor

The second bachelor start of with a first semester of mostly general courses and some more specific ones. The second semester has more in depth and discipline specific courses. Overall, the workload was similar to the previous year all though here are labs and some practical sessions.

<div class="course_list">
* <span class="english">Computer Architecture</span> (<span class="dutch">Computerarchitectuur</span>)<br/>
  A more computer oriented course, with lots of material, but the goal was understanding. The lab sessions are not really related to the theoretical sessions per se, but provide additional material. Overall good course on a global architectural overview of computers.
* <span class="english">Electrical Circuits and Networks</span> (<span class="dutch">Elektrische schakelingen en netwerken</span>)<br/>
  A course on basic circuit analysis. Most of it is on passive linear circuits (capacitors, inductors and resistors). Fundamentals of Bode analysis are also added and at the end non-linear components such as the diode and MOSFET are introduced. Interesting stuff (read: exercises), but lectures were quite boring.
* <span class="english">Science and Philosophy</span> (<span class="dutch">Filosofie en wetenschap</span>)<br/>
  The only social course of the bachelor. I chose philosophy because it was mostly formal logic reasoning. The rest was utterly uninteresting, but better to do this than continue with another business course.
* <span class="english">Engineering Project II</span> (<span class="dutch">Ingenieursproject II</span>)<br/>
  This should actually be called: "Learning how to perform measurements with the oscilloscole and analyse real-lief circuits". It was no real project as one expects, since analogue electronics requires a good understanding of design and measurement equipment. Students just don't have this at this point.
* <span class="english">Materials in Electronics</span> (<span class="dutch">Materialen in de elektronica</span>)<br/>
  More theoretical and physics oriented course than most other courses. Most of the covered topics seem pointless at the time but provide more insight later on in the bachelor.
* <span class="english">Modelling and Control of Dynamic Systems</span> (<span class="dutch">Modelleren en regelen van dynamische systemen</span>)<br/>
  PID controllers, feedback and more. Very interesting topics, but this is a _general_ course, so it also covered chemical and electromechanical applications. Very useful course.
* <span class="english">Physics II</span> (<span class="dutch">Natuurkunde II</span>)<br/>
  More of the same, some relativity and a small intro to quantum mechanics.
* <span class="english">Programming</span> (<span class="dutch">Programmeren</span>)<br/>
  Oh, programming! This time in C and C++. Elementary course for electrical engineers. Theory lectures were boring and applications not always relevant, but at least we got a proper introduction to C++. However, C++11 was a no-go, missed opportunity in my opinion.
* <span class="english">Systems and Signals</span> (<span class="dutch">System en signalen</span>)<br/>
  The most feared course of the entire bachelor. Yes, it's hard, it's theoretical and the exercises can sometimes be a challenge. This course also forms the basics for many other course in different disciplines, so a good understanding is really needed. I did not really enjoy the lectures, but the exercises were fun (there were too few however).
* <span class="english">Applied Probability Calculus</span> (<span class="dutch">Toegepaste probabiliteit</span>)<br/>
  The successor to _Probability Calculus and Statistics_ with additions on PGF, MGF, Markov Chains and more. Mostly not all that interesting to study, but useful for other courses.
* <span class="english">Mathematical Calculus III: Applications of Calculus and Vector Calculus</span> (<span class="dutch">Wiskundige analyse III: toepassingen van analyse en vectoranalyse</span>)<br/>
  Similar to previous courses on analysis. However, this builds (of course) on previous courses and provides very useful concepts in vector calculus that are applied e.g. in electromagnetism. These application are not mentioned in the course, it's mostly theoretical.

### Third Bachelor

<div class="course_list">
* <span class="english">Analogue Electronics</span> (<span class="dutch">Analoge elektronica</span>)<br/>
  Basic of electrical circuits that go beyond simple resistors and diodes. Very essential course for analogue hardware design, useful but there should be more emphasis on exercises, especially in the later chapters.
* <span class="english">Communication Networks</span> (<span class="dutch">Communicatienetwerken</span>)<br/>
  First course in a long series of courses on internet-related topics. Though interesting on their own, a lot of these things are utterly pointless to learn by heart..
* <span class="english">Digital Electronics</span> (<span class="dutch">Digitale elektronica</span>)<br/>
  One should expect the basics of digital electronics, and in a way these are taught, but not as one would expect. It's a rather theoretical course (FPGA design track) with some practical labs in VHDL (interesting!) but not all that much practically applicable.
* <span class="english">Photonics</span> (<span class="dutch">Fotonica</span>)<br/>
  Basically: how to cover everything photonics people might use in one course. The topics were just too broad since this course is taught together with the physics discipline and thus has a lot of overlap with other courses. Does not go very in depth on many topics.
* <span class="english">Multimedia Techniques</span> (<span class="dutch">Multimediatechnieken</span>)<br/>
  Practical sessions were lots of work, sometimes useful and the exam was very easy. Though most of it was too superficial to really be able to change/build upon the concepts discussed here.
* <span class="english">Signal Processing</span> (<span class="dutch">Signaalverwerking</span>)<br/>
  The successor course to _Systems and Signals_, very mathematical and theoretical. I really liked this course quite a lot. Good trade-off between in-depth and different topics.
* <span class="english">???</span> (<span class="dutch">Stromingen en warmteoverdracht in de elektronica</span>)<br/>
  Very simple course. Not that many lectures also, nice addition to the curriculum.
* <span class="english">Applied Electromagnetism</span> (<span class="dutch">Toegepast elektromagnetisme</span>)<br/>
  Another more mathematical course on the basics of Maxwells laws. Very cool project (analyses electrical current in rectangular wire). Overall a good course.
* <span class="english">Interdisciplinary Project</span> (<span class="dutch">Vakoverschrijdend project</span>)<br/>
* <span class="english">Communication Theory</span> (<span class="dutch">Communicatietheorie</span>)<br/>
</div>

## Master of Science in Electrical Engineering: Communication and Information Technology

### First Master

<div class="course_list">
* <span class="english">Antennas and Propagation</span> (<span class="dutch">Antennes en propagatie</span>)<br/>
  How do antennas (aireals) work? How can the radio environment be decribed (path loss, fading, shadowing)? Were some of the major questions addressed in this course. This is a more mathematical course, following the basic consepts from Applied Electromagnetism and I really liked it. There was a project on antenna design in NEC also, but this was not very representative with contemporary antenna design. It was a useful intro though.
* <span class="english">High Speed Electronics</span> (<span class="dutch">Hogesnelheidselektronica</span>)<br/>
  A course on how to design high-speed circuits (mostly in the 10MHz to 1GHz region). The main focus was still on discrete components. Some (basic) circuits were designed in ADS and then built (which proved to be a major challenge sometimes). Elementary concepts such as S-parameters, impedance transformations, noise circles and more were discussed. Most of the topics were covered more on a descritive and condeptial level rather than going through the complex mathematics (as in Antennas and Propagation).
* <span class="english">High Frequency Systems</span> (<span class="dutch">Hoogfrequentsystemen</span>)<br/>
  A course on architectural design of transceiver systems. I really likes this course, and the practical parts of it. It consitsted of limited lectures and a large project troughout the semester.
* <span class="english">Information Security</span> (<span class="dutch">Informatiebeveiliging</span>)<br/>
  One of the better courses from the computer science master. Major topics included symmetrical and assymmerical cryptography, hash functions and protocols (e.g. TLS and SSH). I really liked this course, very interesting lectures. The only minor remark I have is that ECC was only discuessed briefly. A more in-depth analysis might have been more useful, since ECC is becoming more used nowadays.
* <span class="english">Information Theory</span> (<span class="dutch">Informatietheorie</span>)<br/>
  The follow-up of Communication Theory
* <span class="english">Mobile and Broadband Access Networks</span> (<span class="dutch">Mobiele en breedbandtoegangsnetwerken</span>)<br/>
* <span class="english">Design of Analogue Circuits and Building Blocks</span> (<span class="dutch">Ontwerp van analoge schakelingen en bouwblokken</span>)<br/>
* <span class="english">Complex Systems Design Methodology</span> (<span class="dutch">Ontwerpsmethodologie van complexe systemen</span>)<br/>
* <span class="english">VLSI Technology and Design</span> (<span class="dutch">VLSI-technologie en -ontwerp</span>)<br/>
* <span class="english">Queueing Analysis and Simulation</span> (<span class="dutch">Wachtlijnanalyse en simulatie</span>)<br/>
