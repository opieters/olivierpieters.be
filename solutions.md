A set of solutions for problems that need to be handled differently in Hugo

# search

Just use JS+node: https://gist.github.com/sebz/efddfc8fdcb6b480f567

Better markdown strip tool: https://github.com/wooorm/strip-markdown

# Gallery

Use node to create the "overall" JS file from the data files and a JS template. This should simplify the gallery building and maintenance. 

# LaTeX compilation

Maybe try to use some "include" statement? Not sure that this can worke though...
