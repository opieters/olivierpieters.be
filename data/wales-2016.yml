The castle was commissioned by either William the Conqueror or by Robert Fitzhamon, and formed the heart of the medieval town of Cardiff and the Marcher Lord territory of Glamorgan. In the 12th century the castle began to be rebuilt in stone, probably by Robert of Gloucester, with a shell keep and substantial defensive walls being erected. Further work was conducted by Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester in the second half of the 13th century. Cardiff Castle was repeatedly involved in the conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh, being attacked several times in the 12th century, and stormed in 1404 during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr."

In Dan-yr-Ogof you walk through the beautifully decorated passageways for just under 1 kilometre; in Cathedral Cave you walk through its enormous caverns, carved out millions of years ago, and at the end of this cave experience the excitement of walking behind the 40 feet high waterfalls that cascade around you in the ‘Dome of St Paul’s’, an atmospheric end to a truly wonderful cave; and in Bone Cave learn why 42 human skeletons were buried here, and how our ancestors used caves all those years ago."

        title: White Castle
        description: "White Castle, which started life as a simple earthwork stronghold soon after the Norman Conquest, was rebuilt in stone in the later 12th and 13th centuries. Granted to Hubert de Burgh by King John in 1201, the castle convincingly conjures up a romantic vision of the Middle Ages. There is a large and now grassy outer ward enclosed by walls and towers, but it is the self-contained and well-preserved inner ward that captures the imagination. Powerful round towers and high curtain walls, built on a steep earth mound encircled by a deep, water-filled moat, guard the heart of the castle."

        Finches, tits, woodpeckers and nuthatch can all take their fill - and in winter will almost clear out the feeder in the time it takes you to walk round the reserve. Grey squirrels inevitably get a meal out of it as well!

        The range of habitats ensures variety and the trails provide a delightful walk even if you come during summer afternoons when birds are least in evidence. The oakwoods support all the characteristic birds of broadleaved woodland including pied flycatcher, redstart, wood warbler and both great and lesser spotted woodpeckers. The too often despised conifers are preferred by goldcrests and coal tits and in winter attract crossbills.

        On the river look out for red-breasted merganser, a fish-eating duck with a toothed beak to ensure its catch does not escape. Common sandpiper frequent the river margins. In winter a small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese visit the marsh. They can be seen from the observation hides."

        The village was founded around the harbour and shipbuilding industry, but is now best known as a seaside resort with a high quality beach. The town centre is on the river and seafront, around the original harbour, jetty and beach but it stretches back from the coast and up the steep hillside in the midst of typical Welsh coastal scenery of steep green hills and sheep farms. Penhelig, with its own railway station, is the eastern part of the town.

        Aberdyfi is a popular tourist attraction, with many returning holidaymakers, especially from the metropolitan areas of England, such as the West Midlands, which is less than 100 miles to the east. A relatively large proportion of houses in the village are now holiday homes, resulting in high house prices. The town is located within the Snowdonia National Park. In the 2011 census, 38.5% of the population of Aberdyfi ward identified themselves as Welsh (or combined)."

Lying on Tremadog Bay and within the Snowdonia National Park, it has a population of 1,447, of whom 51% speak Welsh.[1] The town is in the unitary authority of Gwynedd which was formed in 1996. From 1974 to 1996 it was in the Meirionydd District of the 1974 County of Gwynedd, and before 1974 it was in the historic county of Merionethshire.

        The town is best known for the landmark Harlech Castle, begun in 1283 by Edward I of England, captured by Owain Glyndŵr, and later the stronghold of Henry Tudor. The castle was built next to the sea, but geological processes have changed the shape of the coastline, and the castle now lies on a cliff face, about half a mile (800 m) inland.[3] The town has since developed, with housing estates on the flat low town area and hillside properties in the high town around the shopping street, church, and castle. The two areas are linked by a steep and winding road called 'Twtil'."

Care should also be taken on the soft cliff tops of boulder clay, remnants from the last Ice Age (walkers are advised to keep away from the cliff edge and from the base of the cliff due to regular landslips). The beach of golden sand with a scattering of pebbles extends for about four miles.

The most fascinating feature of this walk however, is the second highest hill of Tre'r Ceiri; the site of Britain's best preserved and possible the largest remaining Iron Age hill fort. The fort is protected on all sides by an impressive perimeter wall and the interior of the fort contains the remains of over a hundred Iron Age stone round houses. This is an easy to moderate walk, ideal for those days when the higher reaches of Snowdonia are shrouded in cloud and the Llyn Peninsula is still basking in sunshine."

        Some parts of the final section leads along a narrow and rocky path with steep slopes below, so extreme care must be taken on these parts. When there is snow and ice on the ground this part should be left to experienced walkers with the appropriate equipment."

        title: Ranger Path
        description: "This path up Snowdon is thought to be the earliest of the six main routes to the summit. Before the road through Llanberis Pass was built, men lugged copper ore from the Britannia Copper Mine on Snowdon up the eastern side of the mountain to Bwlch Glas.

        Horses would then draw the ore down on a sledge along this path to the shores of Llyn Cwellyn to be transported by horse and cart to Caernarfon.

        The path was named in English after a mountain guide called John Morton who called himself the ‘Snowdon Ranger’. At the beginning of the nineteenth century he built an inn on the site where the Youth Hostel stands today, opposite the car park. The inn was known as the ‘Snowdon Ranger’, ‘Snowdon Inn’ or ‘Glanllyn’ (meaning ‘lakeside’), from where he would guide visitors to the summit of Snowdon along this path.

        The path climbs gradually up to, and around the slopes of Moel Cynghorion to Bwlch Cwm Brwynog. It then climbs steeply over the shoulder above Clogwyn Du’r Arddu before merging with the Llanberis path, and then the Pyg and Miners’ tracks at Bwlch Glas, and then on to the summit."

        This is Great Britain's only remaining cable-operated street tramway, and one of only a few surviving in the world, and it is owned by Conwy County Borough Council. The line comprises two sections, where each section is an independent funicular and passengers change cars at the halfway station. Whilst the upper section runs on its own right of way and is very similar to many other funicular lines, the lower section is an unusual street-running funicular."

Dwynwen is the Welsh patron saint of lovers, making her the Welsh equivalent of St. Valentine. Her Saint's day is 25 January and is often celebrated by the Welsh with cards and flowers. The remains of St Dwynwen's Church can be found.

        There are more than 10 miles of footpaths crossing Llanddwyn Island and Newborough Warren, including the Anglesey Coastal Path, and it is a very popular place to visit. The island provides a worth-while goal after the mile-long walk along the beach from the nearest car park. Llanddwyn Island, with the neighbouring beach, has been awarded Blue Flag beach status in recognition of the cleanliness of the sea and the beaches.

        The Llanddwyn Island Lighthouse marks the western entrance to the Menai Strait."

        description: "Beaumaris Castle, located in the town of the same name on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, was built as part of Edward I's campaign to conquer the north of Wales after 1282. Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete."
