  description: "I am a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University and ILVO, in collaboration with imec and OnePlanet. I recently obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the same university by investigating the computational aspects of plants. During my bachelor and master programmes, I studied electrical engineering with a special focus on communication and information technology.  I'm passionate about science, technology, photography and languages. A five word description of me would be: enthusiastic, observant, perfectionistic, driven and minimalistic."

experience:
  -
    title: Postdoctoral Researcher
    company: Ghent University
    from: March 2022
    to: present
    location: Ghent
    description: Expanding the results towards more plant species and trait observations. This researchs builds on the work done in my PhD and is mainly focussed on broadening it. Moreover, we are also collaborating with OnePlanet to scale the system to bigger expeirmental setups.

    title: PhD Researcher
    company: Ghent University
    from: September 2017
    to: February 2022
    location: Ghent
    description: Evaluating the computational aspects of plants. This research was promoted by Francis wyffels, Tom De Swaef and Michiel Stock. We provided the first proof-of-concept in situ experimental demonstartion of reservoir computing with a strawberry plant. To achieve these results, we worked with a hyperspectral camera and leaf thickness sensors to observe the plant's state. Moreover, we also developed a new measurement platform for deep phenotyping.

    title: Summer Internship
    company: Newtec
    from: June 2015
    to: August 2015
    location: Sint-Niklaas
    description: Redesign and analysis (in terms of computational complexity, design complexity and performance) of existing low-pass filters for parallelised operation. These filters were implemented in VHDL and verified using ModelSim simulations and a Python test bench.

    title: Summer Internship
    company: Huawei
    from: August 2014
    to: September 2014
    location: Shenzhen, Guangdong, China
    description: The Huawei Telecom Seeds for the Future program includes both a cultural and a technical aspect. A Mandarin language training at the University of Geosciences in Beijing and an introduction to Chinese culture and historical landmarks formed the cultural aspect. The technological aspect consisted of a Huawei Training on ICT Technologies & Solutions and work experience at Huawei's Shenzen headquarter.
